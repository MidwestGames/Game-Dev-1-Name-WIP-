# Game Project 1 (Name in progress)

## Ideas
RPG Style Game

### Story
1.) Setting Ideas<br/>
&nbsp; a.) Era much like Horizon series, but not for the same reasons<br/>
&nbsp; b.) Era of tech losses due to solar flares and the moon moving out in its orbit, causing weird climate changes<br/>
2.) Entity Ideas<br/>
&nbsp; a.) Machines like Horizon<br/>
&nbsp; b.) Some wildlife for hunting to get materials for quests and or other mechanic<br/>
&nbsp; c.) People, different tribes<br/>
3.) Item Ideas<br/>
&nbsp; a.) Weapons
&nbsp; &nbsp; i.) Bows and Swords
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.) Customizable furniture and ammunitions
&nbsp; &nbsp; ii.) Firearms
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.) Customizable ammunition
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.) Customizable attachments
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.) Must be incredibly rare, as old world is much destroyed
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.) Can be looted from machines, but these weapons are incredibly difficult to use
&nbsp; &nbsp; iii.) Traps
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.) Usable by engineers for more effect
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.) Traditional dart and spike, but also more "custom" traps
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.) Only type of crafting, but only by the engineer, all other classes are dumb
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.) Magicians can also create magical traps, but take an incredible amount of energy (very powerfull as well)
&nbsp; &nbsp; iv.) Environment
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.) Landscape damage (lava, water, gases)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.) Optional methods of defeat based on location (trees, rocks, certain attack at a certain time)

### Mechanics
1.) Skill system like Dark Souls<br/>
2.) Turn based combat (reminicent of Final Fantasy)<br/>
3.) NO CRAFTING (Only looting to get weapons and gear)<br/>
&nbsp; a.) Player is not well rounded, basically a mercenary for hire<br/>
4.) Classes\* <br/>
&nbsp; a.) Melee<br/>
&nbsp; b.) Ranger<br/>
&nbsp; c.) Engineer<br/>
&nbsp; d.) Healer<br/>
&nbsp; e.) Tamer<br/>
5.) Open world, but linear progression like Final Fantasy<br/>
6.) Day-Night Cycle to have different enemies appear and be weaker or stronger, and other affects
<sub> \*Subclasses in each of these potentially for specing into various types<br/> <sub/>

### Aestetic
1.) Art style<br/>

&nbsp; a.) Overworld map<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; i.) Isometric voxel art<br/>

&nbsp; b.) Overworld playable<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; i.) Sprite based character<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ii.) In-world objects voxelized?<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; iii.) Enemies/Bosses depends on the place and story<br/>

&nbsp; c.) Items/Inventory<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; i.) Tile inventory<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ii.) Fo-Voxel items<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; iii.) Custom font for UI<br/>

&nbsp; d.) Battle Scene<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; i.) Dynamic Backround<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.) Trees/flowers animated<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.) Based on area various fluids moving<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.) Potential for life within the background<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ii.) Characters could be Fo-Voxel or isometric (depending on confidence with modeling)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; iii.) Animations will be mixture of 2D sprites and 3D voxel particals depending on skills<br/>

&nbsp; e.) Would like to try a painting style of art, kind of like Don't Starve, but more painted (wet/brushstroke look)<br/>

2.) Music<br/>

&nbsp; a.) Based on area, will need to find a good set of instruments<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; i.) Can use Finale for the time being to get good MIDI tracks<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ii.) Certain tracks will need to be hand played to emphasize story<br/>

&nbsp; b.) Styles<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; i.) Overworld areas mostly with rock-ish beats<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ii.) Battles with more driving beat and odd instruments based on enemy type/area/boss<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; iii.) Village themes based on regions<br/>

### More things will appear as I see the need

## Goals

1.) Finish the game, even it if takes a few years<br/>
2.) Learn some better practices for modeling, worst skill in workflow<br/>
3.) Learn mechanics like saving progress and true animation rigging<br/>
4.) Learn Unity's visual scripting language for AI and the like developement<br/>
5.) Learn how to make various levels of AI based on game progression<br/>
6.) Dynamically enemy difficulty, both backwards and forwards in game progression<br/>
&nbsp; a.) The beginning areas will scale with your progression as will the forward areas<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; EXAMPLE: If a starting region enemy is "level 1", and you are "level 30", then the starting area will have enemies at "level 20"<br/>
&nbsp; b.) Previous areas will easier still, but will at least have a challenge to them<br/>
7.) Learn better practices of code maintainability and generality<br/>
8.) Learn how to sell the game<br/>
&nbsp; a.) Set up the stuff for Steam<br/>
&nbsp; b.) Set up for GOG<br/>

## ECD Goals
1.) Tenative Alpha - Q2 2023<br/>
2.) Tenative Beta - Q4 2023<br/>
3.) Tenative Early Acces - Q2 2024<br/>
4.) Tenative Full Release - Q1 2025<br/>
