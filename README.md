# Game Project 1 (Name in progress)

## Ideas
RPG Style Game

### Story

### Mechanics
1.) Skill system like Dark Souls<br/>
2.) Turn based combat (reminicent of Final Fantasy)<br/>
3.) NO CRAFTING (Only looting to get weapons and gear)<br/>
&nbsp; a.) Player is not well rounded, basically a mercenary for hire<br/>
4.) Classes\* <br/>
&nbsp; a.) Melee<br/>
&nbsp; b.) Ranger<br/>
&nbsp; c.) Engineer<br/>
&nbsp; d.) Healer<br/>
&nbsp; e.) Tamer<br/>
5.) Open world, but linear progression like Final Fantasy<br/>
<sub> \*Subclasses in each of these potentially for specing into various types<br/> <sub/>

### Aestetic
1.) Art style<br/>

&nbsp; a.) Overworld map<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; i.) Isometric voxel art<br/>

&nbsp; b.) Overworld playable<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; i.) Sprite based character<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ii.) In-world objects voxelized?<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; iii.) Enemies/Bosses depends on the place and story<br/>

&nbsp; c.) Items/Inventory<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; i.) Tile inventory<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ii.) Fo-Voxel items<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; iii.) Custom font for UI<br/>

&nbsp; d.) Battle Scene<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; i.) Dynamic Backround<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.) Trees/flowers animated<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.) Based on area various fluids moving<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.) Potential for life within the background<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ii.) Characters could be Fo-Voxel or isometric (depending on confidence with modeling)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; iii.) Animations will be mixture of 2D sprites and 3D voxel particals depending on skills<br/>

&nbsp; e.) Would like to try a painting style of art, kind of like Don't Starve, but more painted (wet/brushstroke look)<br/>

2.) Music<br/>

&nbsp; a.) Based on area, will need to find a good set of instruments<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; i.) Can use Finale for the time being to get good MIDI tracks<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ii.) Certain tracks will need to be hand played to emphasize story<br/>

&nbsp; b.) Styles<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; i.) Overworld areas mostly with rock-ish beats<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ii.) Battles with more driving beat and odd instruments based on enemy type/area/boss<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; iii.) Village themes based on regions<br/>

### More things will appear as I see the need

## Goals

	1.) Finish the game, even it if takes a few years
	2.) Learn some better practices for modeling, worst skill in workflow
	3.) Learn mechanics like saving progress and true animation rigging
	4.) Learn Unity's visual scripting language for AI and the like developement
	5.) Learn how to make various levels of AI based on game progression
	6.) Dynamically enemy difficulty, both backwards and forwards in game progression
		a.) The beginning areas will scale with your progression as will the forward areas. 
			EXAMPLE: If a starting region enemy is "level 1", and you are "level 30", then the starting area will have enemies at "level 20"
		b.) Previous areas will easier still, but will at least have a challenge to them.
	7.) Learn better practices of code maintainability and generality 
	8.) Learn how to sell the game
		a.) Set up the stuff for Steam
		b.) Set up for GOG

## ECD Goals

	1.) Tenative Alpha - Q2 2023
	2.) Tenative Beta - Q4 2023
	3.) Tenative Early Acces - Q2 2024
	4.) Tenative Full Release - Q1 2025
